          To learn more about Silverlight and how Microsoft defines and markets
          the Silverlight technology, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/what-is-silverlight/">What
          Is Silverlight? document on microsoft.com</a>. </p><p>Once an application author produces a Silverlight application, the
          most common way to deploy that application is to present the Silverlight
          content using a browser plug-in that end users have installed on their
          computers. The Silverlight plug-in is instantiated within an HTML page
          as an &lt;object&gt; or &lt;embed&gt; tag.   &lt;object&gt; tag attributes
          reference Silverlight's unique classid, and/or its MIME type, thus
          invoking a plug-in instance within the browser host's HTML content.
          Users request the Silverlight-containing page as a URL, and the surrounding
          HTML plus the Silverlight content is viewed within a browser host such
          as Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Safari. There are
          other means by which Silverlight-developed content can be deployed
          that are NOT viewed in the plug-in or hosted by HTML; this is discussed
          in the upcoming section "Browser Host Platform Considerations". </p><p>The content that is displayed within the Silverlight content area
          is specified as the "source" parameter, within the Silverlight
          object/embed tag. The "source" parameter value references
          a URI for a package. The package is typically served by the same server
          that served the HTML (and the package itself is typically requested
          through http: or https: protocol). The package always contains an application
          manifest, and a managed code compiled DLL. The package might also contain
          other content, for example media files or image files that the application
          consumes as resources. The compiled DLL typically contains two types
          of information within its compiled structure: CLR runtime code that
          handles dynamic operations of the application such as startup logic,
          business rules, event handlers, and further resources. The resources
          inside the DLL are primarily UI definitions in a markup format/language
          called XAML. </p><p>Silverlight provides a combination of built-in support for accessibility
          and capabilities that authors and authoring tools can take advantage
          of in order to enable support for accessible content. Tools and related
          technologies that are related to this include: </p><ul><li><p> Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (or Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
            if still developing for version 3 of the Silverlight runtime) – Silverlight authors
            can use Express versions if their development needs are fairly basic </p></li><li><p> Microsoft Expression products, in particular Microsoft Expression
            Blend </p></li><li><p> Silverlight Tools – a separate package for Visual Studio that
            should be installed for effective Silverlight application development </p></li><li><p> Developer tools that are specifically for verification of information
            presented to either the UIA or MSAA accessibility frameworks. </p></li></ul><div class="div3"><h3><a name="silverlight_notes_frameworks" id="silverlight_notes_frameworks"> </a> Accessibility Frameworks </h3><p>Silverlight support for assistive technologies is based on implementing
          Silverlight for Microsoft UI Automation (often abbreviated as UIA).
          In the UIA accessibility framework, Silverlight is implemented as a
          UI Automation server. This means that Silverlight provides information
          about the application itself and its current content through the framework.
          Any subscriber to the operating system's automation can consume that
          information as a UI Automation client. One such client role is typically
          implemented by assistive technologies, most notably by screen readers.
          By acting as a UI Automation client, an assistive technology can programmatically
          determine many aspects of Silverlight content and content structure.
          In addition, UIA has APIs that can change the content in a predictable
          way that maintains security boundaries between applications. Reading
          information from Silverlight through the UIA accessibility framework
          requires no extra work on the part of a given assistive technology,
          presuming that the assistive technology has already implemented UIA.
          All information that Silverlight reports to UIA comes through the common
          property set, and a fixed set of possible user interactions is programmatically
          accessible through a discoverable set of automation patterns and techniques. </p><p>As an example of how UI Automation might provide information to an
          assistive technology, consider the following scenario: </p><ol class="enumar"><li><p> A Silverlight application author produces an application that
            follows all Microsoft-documented best practices for providing accessibility
            information, either by specific programming actions or by relying
            on a known set of Silverlight default behaviors (many of these actions/behaviors
            are also described as Silverlight WCAG techniques). </p></li><li><p> A user views a Web page that contains Silverlight content, using
            a browser host that loads the HTML, and using an operating system
            such as Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista or Windows 7) that supports
            UI Automation. </p></li><li><p> An assistive technology that is already running on the user's
            system loads the UIA representation of all Web content loaded by
            the browser. Part of that representation is an automation element
            that represents the Silverlight plug-in. The plug-in content area
            itself is focusable in the browser host's HTML rendering and representation
            model. </p></li><li><p> The user navigates elements in the Silverlight application area,
            either by using the TAB sequence, or by using navigation techniques
            implemented by a particular assistive technology. </p></li><li><p> By forwarding information that is pertinent to either the navigated-to
            element or the application in general, the accessibility framework
            provides the assistive technology with the information from Silverlight
            application. As a specific example, a screen reader might read the
            name and role of the currently focused control element such as a
            Silverlight <code>TextBox</code>. In addition, the assistive
            technology can provide means to enter data or otherwise interact
            with elements of that application, if that element reports to UIA
            that it supports such interaction. </p></li></ol><p>A good introductory topic on UI Automation is available on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms747327.aspx">MSDN</a>. </p><p>UI Automation supersedes Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), an
          earlier Microsoft accessibility framework. UI Automation provides built-in
          bridging support for MSAA, such that assistive technologies that are
          implemented as clients for MSAA rather than UIA receive the expected
          interface hooks for IAccessible and can call methods of the MSAA interfaces.
          Also, applications that provide MSAA/ IAccessible are readable to a
          UIA-client assistive technology through similar bridging. </p><p>Whether implemented as clients for UI Automation or for MSAA, support
          for assistive technologies is provided for users viewing content using
          combinations of: </p><ul><li><p> Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or later, in combination with Microsoft
            Silverlight on Windows. </p></li><li><p> Mozilla Firefox 3 or later, in combination with Microsoft Silverlight
            on Windows. </p></li><li><p> Google Chrome 4 or later, in combination with Microsoft Silverlight
            on Windows </p></li></ul><p>Screen reader assistive technology support for either MSAA or UIA
          is provided in several assistive technologies, including but not limited
          to: </p><ul><li><p> JAWS </p></li><li><p> Windows-Eyes </p></li><li><p> NVDA </p></li><li><p> Microsoft Narrator </p></li></ul><p>The exact level of support to assistive technologies will partially
          depend on whether that assistive technology is implemented as a UIA
          client or an MSAA client. This can vary depending on specific version
          releases of the assistive technology. In general, the UIA architecture
          is capable of reporting a richer information set to clients than is
          MSAA. This is because UIA has a larger number of properties available,
          and also because UIA has the patterns concept to support class extension
          whereas MSAA does not (class extension is a key concept in Silverlight
          programming). </p><p>Silverlight uses UI Automation support as a general system that addresses
          parts or entireties of many WCAG criteria at a system/platform level,
          rather than requiring each Silverlight author to build the entirety
          of such support as an individually coded feature of a Silverlight application.
          The following is a list of criteria where UI Automation support in
          Silverlight is necessary to apply the Silverlight WCAG techniques,
          and the application must be on a client and platform that also supports
          UIA (or MSAA): </p><ul><li><p>

                     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html">Success
            Criterion 4.1.2 (Name Role Value)</a> directly influenced the design
            of both the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility framework and its
            MSAA predecessor. Many aspects of providing name, role and value
            are built-in to the Silverlight UIA support, and that information
            can be programmatically determined by assistive technologies that
            are programmed as UI Automation clients. </p><div><h5><a name="silverlight_notes_frameworks_nrv_name" id="silverlight_notes_frameworks_nrv_name"> </a> Name </h5><p>In most cases, the name of the control is used to identify that control
          to users, as well as providing a programmatic identifier. In UI Automation
          programming, any entity that can have a name is represented as an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.aspx">AutomationElement</a>,
          and its name is determined by reading the value of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.name.aspx">AutomationElementInformation.Name
          property</a>. There is an intermediate "Current" property,
          so an example usage is something like: </p><p>
                        <code>string AName = anAutomationElement.Current.Name;  </code>
                     </p><p>
                        <code>Name</code> is the most common UI Automation property
            that is consumed by assistive technologies. Application authors in
            general that rely on UI Automation (and Silverlight application authors
            in particular) typically provide strings for <code>Name</code> that
            can inform users of the purpose that the element serves in the application.
            For example, if an application provides a button that can be activated,
            the <code>Name</code> reported to UI Automation could best describe
            its purpose by using a <code>Name</code> string something like "Submit
            form". While there is some crossover here with the concept of
            Value, what is notable about <code>Name</code> is that it is
            controlled only by the application rather than typical means of user
            input that would alter the data of Value. </p><p>Because UI Automation is also used as a framework for automation testing
          of applications, UI Automation supports a parallel identification property
          named <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.automationid.aspx">AutomationId</a>. <code>AutomationID</code> is
          not relevant to accessibility support scenarios, although in practice <code>Name</code> and <code>AutomationID</code> sometimes
          use the same string values, or are supported by parallel property-forwarding
          techniques by implementing technologies. The intended design difference
          between <code>AutomationId</code> and <code>Name</code> is
          the following: </p><ul><li><p> 
                              <code>AutomationID</code> is not intended to be human readable,
            but is intended to be unique </p></li><li><p> 
                              <code>Name</code> is intended to be human readable but might
            not be unique </p></li></ul><p>Silverlight in particular has a property-forwarding technique whereby
          the Silverlight-specific <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.frameworkelement.name%28VS.95%29.aspx">Name</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189028(VS.95).aspx">x:Name</a> properties
          are promoted as the initial <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.name.aspx">AutomationElementInformation.Name</a>.
          This forwarding is implemented within build procedures to provide a
          fallback for testing and initial development of an application's UI
          Automation representation. In many cases a forwarded Name/x:Name does
          not result in a particularly human-comprehensible or user-actionable
          string or phrase. Silverlight application authors should use a test-based
          methodology to examine all possible <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.name.aspx">AutomationElementInformation.Name</a> values
          exposed by their application, and assure that each such string is specifically
          replaced by a UI-specific <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationproperties.name%28VS.95%29.aspx">AutomationProperties.Name
          value</a>. </p></div><div><h5><a name="silverlight_notes_frameworks_nrv_role" id="silverlight_notes_frameworks_nrv_role"> </a> Role </h5><p>Role in UI Automation can be determined through several techniques. </p><p>The most straightforward technique for determining a given AutomationElement's
          role is to check the value of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.controltype.aspx">ControlType</a>.
          This value provides an enumeration that reports role as several known
          possibilities plus an alternate role of "Custom" if no enumeration-defined
          role is a good descriptor. For example, a Silverlight <code>Button</code> control
          describes itself to UI Automation as a ControlType of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.controltype.button.aspx">Button</a>,
          and a Silverlight <code>TreeView</code> describes itself as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.peers.automationcontroltype%28VS.95%29.aspx">Tree</a>. </p><p>For further information on roles, UI Automation clients can query
          an AutomationElement to see which UI Automation patterns that element
          supports. The patterns describe expectations of the interaction model,
          and the patterns themselves expose the methods that clients should
          call to engage that interaction. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms741836.aspx">Get
          Supported UI Automation Control Patterns on MSDN</a>. </p></div><div><h5><a name="silverlight_notes_frameworks_nrv_value" id="silverlight_notes_frameworks_nrv_value"> </a> Value </h5><p>In MSAA, the "Value" concept was addressed by the simple
          property <code>Value</code> and had to be represented as a string.
          One of the major refinements of UIA over MSAA is to expand what types
          of data can be expected to exist as a value. For this reason, determining "Value" requires
          a larger understanding of UI Automation and how to access UI Automation
          patterns exposed by each peer, and is not discussed further in this
          document. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms741836.aspx">Get
          Supported UI Automation Patterns</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms746719.aspx">UI
          Automation Control Patterns for Clients</a>. The most basic concept
          of Value is often represented by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.valuepattern.aspx">ValuePattern</a>,
          but UI Automation clients should be aware of the larger range of patterns
          that can possibly return or provide a value. In general, the UIA Value
          pattern is only relevant for setting the value directly, such as in
          a text box where a user types or otherwise inputs a string or phrase. </p><p>State is also a related concept to value. UI Automation elements typically
          report states that make sense given their role, and such state is reported
          in the provider implementations. There are also some generalized state
          properties available in any automation element. Examples of these include: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.haskeyboardfocus.aspx">HasKeyboardFocus</a>; <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.isoffscreen.aspx">IsOffscreen</a>. </p></div></div><div class="div4"><h4><a name="silverlight_notes_frameworks_concepts" id="silverlight_notes_frameworks_concepts"> </a> Object Tree Concepts and UI Automation Tree Views </h4><p>The object tree is composed of all the programming constructs that
          a Silverlight application author explicitly declares by writing XAML
          UI definitions (which are initially loaded by the Silverlight runtime)
          and by invoking run-time code. The relationships between nodes in XAML
          markup, and the declaration order of peer elements in XAML, create
          identical relationships/orders in the object tree representation. In
          code, order is made explicitly by using structured definitions and
          APIs of various types of collections (list, dictionaries, etc.) that
          are common in .NET Framework programming. For example, to get the first
          child of a StackPanel named myPanel, call myPanel.Childen[0]
          (.NET collections are zero-index based). Parent-child relationships
          are declared by how specific properties are set. For example, to add
          a   "newButton" child element to myPanel as the last child,
          call myPanel.Children.Add(newButton). </p><p>An object tree representation forms the basis of the Silverlight run-time
          programming model, and enables programmatic access to every programming
          entity or element part of a running Silverlight application. The object
          tree representation is particularly useful for accessibility frameworks,
          and in turn for assistive technologies that use the accessibility framework
          as a client. The relationships and item order in the object tree also
          define the default reading order, as well as the default tab sequence
          for default Silverlight key handling. The Silverlight plug-in code
          that renders Silverlight content into the plug-in display area is literally
          reading the same run-time object tree that is being simultaneously
          reported to the accessibility frameworks or other subsystems of Silverlight
          (for example, printing APIs). </p><p>Silverlight supports UI Automation (UIA) as its primary accessibility
          framework on Windows platform. Silverlight also provides accessibility
          information to MSAA, by reporting information through the UIA-MSAA
          bridge. By using the APIs of the relevant accessibility framework,
          assistive technologies and other accessibility framework clients can
          discover the information and relationships declared in a Silverlight
          application's runtime object tree. The accessibility framework APIs
          work against the UI automation tree in a manner that does not require
          any specific knowledge of the Silverlight programming model. For example,
          the UI Automation APIs use an abstraction of a <code>UIAutomationElement</code> to
          represent any accessible Silverlight object. By calling UI Automation
          APIs against this abstracted object, accessibility framework clients
          can determine any child elements and their count, check parent elements,
          can obtain name/role/value of that <code>UIAutomationElement</code>,
          and so on. In fact, Silverlight accessibility support in general is
          achieved without assistive technologies even being aware that Silverlight
          is a distinct technology from HTML. This is because Silverlight implements
          its accessibility framework support such that Silverlight dovetails
          into the surrounding HTML content through the connection point of the "SilverlightControl" <code>UIAutomationElement</code> that
          exists within the browser host's HTML content. </p><p>For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee684009%28VS.85%29.aspx">UI

          The key concept here is that each call to a Silverlight collection <code>Add</code> method

          a collection’s order, add the intended first item with the first
          call to <code>Add</code>, the second item in the next line of code,
          and so on. This code is analogous to what a XAML parser does when it
          processes the previous XAML example, and results in the same visible
          UI and same default tab order. </p><p>

          interaction with browser zoom is further discussed in the Silverlight

          browser zoom as a feature, and in the Firefox implementation the text

          the release date of the latest Silverlight runtime; sometimes this

          as an ActiveX control or as an NPAPI plugin. When a user installs Silverlight,
          they are installing both of these implementations, such that the same
          Silverlight installation could be accessed by an Internet Explorer
          browser host and a Firefox browser host, and could even be accessed
          simultaneously by both. Differences between the program access layers
          of ActiveX versus NPAPI, and also browser-specific differences in program
          access layers, produce some platform differences that occasionally
          relate to accessibility support. For example, there can be slight differences
          in whether the program access layer will correctly forward certain
          keys or key combinations, which might impact keyboard-mouse equivalence
          implementations. </p><p>Silverlight also supports modes that do not rely on a browser host
          at all. In previous releases of Silverlight, Silverlight was defined
          as a platform for producing rich Internet applications. This is still
          true, but in the current Silverlight release the deployment options
          are expanded such that a Silverlight application is not necessarily
          a web-based application, and Silverlight is not exclusively a Web content
          technology. </p><p>Silverlight supports an out of browser deployment mode. Through UI
          in an initial Web-based Silverlight application, the user is asked
          to conform whether they wish to install the out-browser application.
          If the user approves the installation, the Web-based Silverlight application
          shuts down and the installation begins. Typically, the application
          restarts itself immediately after the installation. Once installed
          on the user's hard disk, a Silverlight out-of-browser functions more
          as an application window under the control of the current platform
          operating system. This is manifested through technical aspects such
          as a change in programming security boundaries, and addition of operating-system-specific
          application model features for the Silverlight out-of-browser application.
          Examples of the latter include icons and presence in running-application
          UI metaphors such as task bars. Out-of-browser mode is not specifically
          mentioned in the Silverlight WCAG techniques, because in this mode
          Silverlight is no longer a Web application. However, an out-of-browser
          Silverlight application can include an embedded control that is itself
          capable of displaying HTML. In this situation, Silverlight accesses
          basic HTML browser frameworks provided by the platform, and any techniques
          that would normally apply to HTML content and Web content could also
          apply to the HTML as viewed within a Silverlight out-of-browser application.
          For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd550721%28VS.95%29.aspx">MSDN</a>. </p><p>Silverlight is also a development platform that can be used to create
          applications for Windows Phone. While these applications often rely
          on Internet connectivity, these applications are run in the context
          of an application directly under the Windows Phone operating system,
          rather than being run in an intermediate Web host that serves as a
          generalized Web browser for Windows Phone. Therefore the typical considerations
          of Silverlight acting as a part of a larger definition of Web content
          do not apply. For more information on Silverlight for Windows Phone
          development, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff402528%28VS.92%29.aspx">The
          Silverlight and XNA Frameworks for Windows Phone on MSDN</a>. </p></div><div class="div3"><h3><a name="silverlight_notes_xaml" id="silverlight_notes_xaml"> </a> The XAML Language </h3><p>XAML is an abbreviation for eXtensible Application Markup Language.
          In the Silverlight application model, XAML is generally used for defining
          the elements that make up an application's user interface (UI). XAML
          markup for UI resembles markup paradigms for HTML in that it uses angle
          brackets in its syntax, has concepts of elements and attributes, and
          uses a predominately text-based file editing and storage format such
          that XAML is human-readable in a text editor. The UI design role typically
          designs an application user interface by interacting with graphical
          user interface tools such as Microsoft Expression Blend. In this case,
          Expression Blend produces XAML as its output, and XAML becomes the
          interchange format between the Expression Blend tool and the Visual
          Studio tools. Visual Studio is more typically used by code-oriented
          Web developers for Silverlight. Web developers in Visual Studio might
          work with XAML at the text level, and write or change the XAML markup,
          and more than one interchange between tools and/or roles of a given
          XAML file might occur by the time the application is finished. The
          Silverlight techniques are written from the perspective of the code-oriented
          Web developer who is possibly adjusting post-design phase XAML. </p><p>One key difference between HTML and XAML is that XAML is always interpreted
          by the Silverlight runtime, or preparsed at compile time within Silverlight
          tools. XAML is NOT parsed by potentially different engines per browser
          host. Because XAML provides UI definition, the Silverlight techniques
          often include procedures or concepts that adjust the elements and attributes
          of XAML markup for an application. Some of the techniques show procedures
          or concepts for code-behind, scripting, deployment steps, or other
          aspects of Silverlight programming in addition to or instead of XAML
          examples. The runtime parsing characteristics of XAML for Silverlight
          is discussed further in the Silverlight WCAG technique <a href="SL33.html"><em>SL33: Using Well-Formed XAML to Define a Silverlight User Interface</em></a>. </p><p>XAML attributes sometimes specify strings that are visible in UI and
          reported to assistive technologies. The Silverlight WCAG techniques
          typically hard-code such UI strings in XAML, so that the example code
          can be kept simple and can concentrate on the immediate concept being
          illustrated. However, hard-coding UI strings in XAML is not a best
          practice for production code, because of localizion considerations.
          To learn more about producing XAML that is localization-ready, or about
          refactoring XAML to support better designer-coder-localizer workflows,
          see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc838238(VS.95).aspx">Localizing
          Silverlight-based Applications</a> on MSDN. </p></div><div class="div3"><h3><a name="silverlight_notes_text-methodology" id="silverlight_notes_text-methodology"> </a> Test-based Methodology for Accessibility Support </h3><p>Some of the Silverlight WCAG techniques mention a concept of   "test-based
          methodology" - this section describes what is meant by that concept. </p><p>In typical Web application development, there are phases that are
          a natural part of the workflow. First there is a specification phase,
          where the basic planning is performed. The next two phases are user
          interface design (often interweaved with user experience design) and
          code development. For larger applications or applications that are
          built on frameworks, the human role of designer is often separate from
          the human role of code developer/script developer. For this reason
          the UI design phase and code phase might be going on concurrently,
          and/or might be iterative. At the point where the efforts of UI design
          and code development are combined into a working application, many
          Web developers now introduce a testing phase. It is at this point that
          a test-based methodology for accessibility support becomes an appropriate
          and useful strategy. </p><p>Testers for Web applications sometimes rely largely on ad hoc or experiential
          tests, but increasingly there are tools available that assist with
          the job of testing a Web site. Many of these tools focus on specific
          aspects of testing: sub-areas such as testing under specific browser
          hosts; testing with stored state or data vs. initial experience; testing
          for different form factors; etc. One such sub-area of testing is testing
          the existing accessibility support. </p><p>Because Silverlight supports the UI Automation accessibility framework,
          the best tools for testing accessibility support in a Silverlight application
          are the tools that work with UI Automation as their basis. Some of
          these tools are available from Microsoft, and other such tools are
          available from third parties. </p><p>In a test-based methodology, a tester should view the application
          in its UIA representation. Using tools, testers can write tests for
          certain conditions and determine whether the application as a whole
          passes or fails. For example, a scripted test could determine whether
          all the controls in a UIA view have a valid string for <code>Name</code>.
          No <code>Name</code> string would potentially cause an assistive
          technology to misrepresent that element, and could cause confusion
          for user groups that rely on a particular assistive technology view
          of an application. In cases where an application failed these kinds
          of tests, the application might be sent back to the human role of developer/script
          writer, so that the missing accessibility information can be committed
          to the application code base. Then the application can be re-tested. </p><p>A test-based methodology for accessibility support works best because
          Silverlight is such an extensive development platform. Sometimes it
          is not immediately obvious to a developer that a certain property required
          for accessibility remained unset. Or perhaps that developer was expecting
          that the human design role would have introduced that information as
          part of UI definition. Only when the integration of UI design and code
          is complete is it possible to see that there is still information or
          functionality missing. When the development process includes a testing
          step wherein dedicated tests for accessibility support are committed
          in a systematic way, it is much more likely that issues can be detected
          prior to application deployment. </p></div><div class="div3"><h3><a name="silverlight_notes_test-files" id="silverlight_notes_test-files"> </a> Running Silverlight Test Files Provided with Techniques </h3><p>Most Silverlight WCAG Techniques reference one or more ZIP files from

            the test based on the current system's file associations for HTML,
            open the HTML with the associated browser. Otherwise, you must open
            the specific browser you want to test under, and type or copy either
            a file:/// URL or a Windows folder path into that browser's address
            bar. </p></li><li><p> This should open the HTML page. When the HTML page opens, it instantiates
            a Silverlight plug-in within the page content, which in turn references
            the other extracted file (the XAP) as local content. </p></li><li><p> Once the content is in view, follow the remaining steps that are

          can observe the basic operation of a technique without having to write
          the code yourself, or create your own application. The salient parts
          of Silverlight code or Silverlight XAML for the technique are provided
          as code blocks under the Examples section. In order to experiment more
          with the technique beyond running the test file, you might want to
          define your own Silverlight application project, and then import the
          code and XAML from the technique into your own project. This section
          describes the basic information that is necessary to create a project
          that incorporates sample code from a Silverlight technique. </p><div class="div4"><h4><a name="silverlight_notes_sample-code_prerequisites" id="silverlight_notes_sample-code_prerequisites"> </a> Prerequisites </h4><p>Creating a Silverlight application project requires that you have
          a full Silverlight application development environment installed. Although
          Silverlight applications run cross-platform, the actual development
          of Silverlight applications is done on Microsoft Windows computers.
          The computer must have Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or Microsoft Visual
          Studio 2010 installed. With some limitations, the Express SKUs of Visual
          Studio are adequate for basic Silverlight application development.
          The Express SKUs are available for 30-day evaluation from the following
          URL: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=323467">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=323467</a> .
          In addition to Visual Studio, you also should install the Silverlight
          Tools, which includes the Silverlight SDK. Get Silverlight Tools from <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=177428">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=177428</a>.
          What to install for Silverlight development is also linked to and explained
          at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/silverlight/bb187358.aspx">Silverlight.net</a>. </p></div><div class="div4"><h4><a name="silverlight_notes_sample-code_project" id="silverlight_notes_sample-code_project"> </a> Creating the Project </h4><p>For general instructions, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc838164(VS.95).aspx">How
            to: Create a New Silverlight Project</a>. This creates a new project
            based on a default template. </p><p>The C# code or XAML shown in the Silverlight techniques is a usually
          a fragment that you should integrate into an existing code file or
          XAML page from the default project template. For code, you generally
          open the file page.xaml.cs from Solution Explorer, and paste the entirety
          of the example code into the body of the C# public partial class that
          you start with (this class comes from a template). For XAML, you generally
          open page.xaml from Solution Explorer and paste the entirety of the
          XAML into the &lt;Grid&gt; element. In some cases the example XAML
          is the entire XAML (you can identify this case if the example XAML
          contains one or more xmlns attributes). In this case, replace the entirety
          of the XAML. However, you may have to adjust the value of the x:Class
          attribute to properly reference your own partial class; this name is
          influenced by your own project naming in your local project and thus
          cannot be anticipated by the example code. Descibing Silverlight application
          development in its entirety is well beyond the scope of this document.

          be embedded within an HTML page that has a page title in the HTML title
          element. </p><p>3.1.1 Language of Page - The language of an HTML page is established
          by the <code>Lang</code> attribute of the containing object element in HTML. However,
          Silverlight's own logic generally interprets language/culture information
          using a Microsoft .NET Framework concept of the CultureInfo object.
          This makes it important to align the HTML-level lang with any CultureInfo
          as used by Silverlight. The reason for this is that assistive technologies
          are likely to respect the top-level declaration of the <code>Lang</code> attribute
          and to not be aware of the CultureInfo considerations of embedded Silverlight
          content. Application authors can delibrately override language settings
          of a client by specifying a discrete CultureInfo in the Silverlight &lt;object&gt; parameters;
          this can be useful if the application has real-time language switching,
          if users store language preferences either locally or based on server
          information or cookies, etc. Aligning html-lang with CultureInfo and
          adjusting the CultureInfo through various means are both discussed
          in Silverlight techniques. </p></div><!-- BOTTOM NAVIGATION BAR --><ul id="navigationbottom"><li><strong><a href="#top">このページの先頭へ</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="Overview.html#contents" title="Table of Contents">目次</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="intro.html" title="Introduction to Techniques for WCAG 2.0"><abbr title="Introduction">イントロダクション</abbr></a></strong></li><li><a title="FLASH36: 点滅を制御し、5 秒以内に点滅を停止させるために、スクリプトを使用する" href="FLASH36.html"><strong>前: </strong>
